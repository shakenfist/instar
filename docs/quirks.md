# qemu-img Quirks

This document describes known behaviors in qemu-img that differ from what one
might expect, and how imago handles these cases.

## QCOW2 disk_size Calculation

### Observed Behavior

For QCOW2 files, `qemu-img info` reports a `disk size` that may differ from the
actual file size on disk. For example, with a generated QCOW2 v2 test file:

- Actual file size (from `stat` or `ls -l`): 196616 bytes
- qemu-img reported disk size: 197120 bytes (192 KiB)
- Difference: 504 bytes

### Root Cause

qemu-img calculates the "disk size" based on the QCOW2 internal structure,
specifically by finding the highest allocated offset in the file's metadata
(L1 table, refcount table, etc.) and rounding up to a sector boundary (512
bytes).

For the test file:
- L1 table offset: 196608 (0x30000)
- L1 table has 1 entry (8 bytes)
- Actual file end: 196608 + 8 = 196616 bytes
- qemu-img calculation: 196608 + 512 = 197120 bytes (sector-aligned)

### Why This Happens

qemu-img appears to calculate "disk size" as the expected size based on the
image's internal structure, not the actual filesystem size. This calculation:

1. Finds the highest used offset in metadata structures
2. Rounds up to the nearest sector boundary (512 bytes)
3. Reports this as the "disk size"

This approach makes sense for images that might be sparse or have trailing
allocations, but can report larger sizes than the actual file.

### imago Behavior

**Default behavior**: imago matches qemu-img by calculating disk size based
on the image's internal metadata structure, rounded up to sector boundaries.
This ensures drop-in replacement compatibility.

**With `--ignore-quirks` flag**: imago reports the actual file size from the
underlying storage, matching what `stat` or `ls -l` reports.

### Why Match qemu-img?

Since imago aims to be a drop-in replacement for `qemu-img info`, matching
the output exactly (including this calculation) reduces friction for users
migrating from qemu-img. Scripts and tools that parse qemu-img output will
work unchanged.

The `--ignore-quirks` flag provides an escape hatch for users who need the
true filesystem size.

### Test Implications

The test file `qcow2_v2.qcow2` in imago-testdata was generated with qemu-img
(`qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o compat=0.10 ...`). By matching qemu-img's
calculation, tests can perform exact output comparison.

## Block-Rounded Disk Size

### Observed Behavior

qemu-img reports "disk size" rounded up to filesystem block boundaries (4096
bytes), not the actual file size.

For the QCOW2 v2 test file:
- Actual file size: 196616 bytes
- qemu-img disk size: 200704 bytes (196 KiB)
- Calculation: ceil(196616 / 4096) * 4096 = 49 * 4096 = 200704

### imago Behavior

**Default behavior**: imago matches qemu-img by rounding file size up to
4096-byte blocks.

**With `--ignore-quirks` flag**: imago reports the actual file size.

## Human-Readable Size Formatting

### Observed Behavior

qemu-img uses `%0.3g` printf format (3 significant figures) for human-readable
sizes. This has different rounding behavior depending on the magnitude:

**For values >= 100** (displayed as integers):

The C `%0.3g` format truncates (floors) to the nearest integer:
- 192.5 KiB → "192 KiB" (floors from 192.5)
- 127.9 GiB → "127 GiB" (floors from 127.9)

**For values 10-99** (displayed with 1 decimal place):

Standard rounding applies:
- 20.6875 MiB → "20.7 MiB" (rounds from 20.6875)
- 15.44 KiB → "15.4 KiB" (rounds from 15.44)

### Technical Details

This behavior stems from C printf's `%0.3g` format which:
1. Rounds to 3 significant figures using standard IEEE rounding
2. Removes trailing zeros after the decimal point
3. For integer results, displays no decimal point

The "flooring" appearance for >= 100 values occurs because the result has no
decimal places to display, and the rounding happens at the third significant
digit (which is already in the integer part).

Rust's `f64::round()` uses "round half away from zero", which differs from
C's "round half to even" (banker's rounding). This causes discrepancies for
values exactly at the midpoint (e.g., 192.5). imago uses floor for >= 100
values to match qemu-img's observed output.

### imago Behavior

**Default behavior**: imago matches qemu-img's formatting:
- Values >= 100: floor to integer
- Values 10-99: round to 1 decimal place
- Values 1-9: round to 2 decimal places
- Values < 1: round to 3 decimal places

**With `--ignore-quirks` flag**: imago uses consistent rounding with 1 decimal
place when the value is not a whole number (e.g., "192.5 KiB" instead of
"192 KiB").

## Child Node File Length

### Observed Behavior

In qemu-img 8.0+, the Child node '/file' section reports a "file length" (human)
or "virtual-size" (JSON) that may differ from the actual filesystem size.

qemu-img reports the **larger** of:
1. The actual filesystem file size
2. The calculated size based on internal metadata (e.g., L1 table offset
   rounded up to sector boundary for QCOW2)

For files with data beyond the metadata structures (like real disk images),
qemu-img reports the actual file size. For minimal files where the metadata
calculation exceeds the actual size (like empty test images), it reports the
metadata-based calculation.

### Example

For a minimal QCOW2 v2 test file:
- Actual file size: 196616 bytes
- L1 table calculation: (196608 + 512) = 197120 bytes
- qemu-img file length: max(196616, 197120) = 197120 bytes

For a real disk image (cirros):
- Actual file size: 21692416 bytes
- L1 table calculation: much smaller (metadata is at the start)
- qemu-img file length: max(21692416, calc) = 21692416 bytes

### imago Behavior

**Default behavior**: imago matches qemu-img by reporting the larger of the
actual file size and the internal metadata calculation.

**With `--ignore-quirks` flag**: imago reports the actual filesystem size.

## Summary of `--ignore-quirks` Effects

When `--ignore-quirks` is specified:

| Field | Default (qemu-img compatible) | With --ignore-quirks |
|-------|------------------------------|---------------------|
| disk size | Block-rounded (4096 bytes) | Actual file size |
| file length | max(actual, metadata calc) | Actual file size |
| Size formatting | 3 significant figures | 1 decimal place |

## File Sparseness and Git

### Observed Behavior

qemu-img's reported "disk size" depends on the actual allocation of sparse
files on disk. When disk images are transferred through git (clone, fetch),
sparse holes may be filled with zeros, increasing the reported disk size.

For example, the `iotest-dynamic-1G.vhdx` file:
- Original (sparse): disk size 66.1 MiB
- After git clone: disk size 100 MiB (holes filled with zeros)
- After `fallocate -d`: disk size 66.1 MiB (holes restored)

### Root Cause

Git stores file contents as blobs and does not preserve sparse file semantics.
When git writes a file during checkout, it writes all bytes sequentially,
effectively "filling in" sparse holes with actual zero bytes. This increases
the file's allocated blocks on disk.

### CI/Testing Implications

Test baselines are generated with sparse files. When the testdata repository
is cloned in CI, the files may lose sparseness, causing disk_size mismatches.

### Solution

After cloning the testdata repository, restore sparse holes using
`cp --sparse=always` which is more robust than `fallocate -d`:

```bash
find downloaded/ -type f \( \
    -name "*.qcow2" -o \
    -name "*.vmdk" -o \
    -name "*.vhd" -o \
    -name "*.vhdx" -o \
    -name "*.img" \
\) -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do
    cp --sparse=always "$file" "$file.sparse"
    mv "$file.sparse" "$file"
done
```

**Why `cp --sparse=always` instead of `fallocate -d`?**

`fallocate -d` (FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE) can only punch holes in contiguous
zero-filled regions that are aligned to filesystem block boundaries. Files
with partial zero blocks (blocks containing mostly zeros but a few non-zero
bytes) cannot have those regions converted to holes.

`cp --sparse=always` reads the file content and writes a new file, skipping
zero-filled blocks entirely. This correctly handles files with complex sparse
patterns where `fallocate -d` would leave extra blocks allocated.

### Note

This is not a qemu-img quirk per se, but rather a filesystem/git interaction
that affects qemu-img output consistency in CI environments.

## Future Additions

Additional quirks will be documented here as they are discovered during
compatibility testing.

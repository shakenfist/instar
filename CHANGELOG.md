## [0.2.0] - Unreleased

First public release.

### Changed

- **Project renamed** from `imago` to `instar` to avoid a
  crates.io name collision with an unrelated existing crate.
  The rename touches the binary name, crate names, environment
  variables, CI workflows, and documentation; there are no
  functional changes.
- **Guest binary resolver** now probes `INSTAR_BIN_DIR`, the
  executable directory, and `/usr/lib/instar/` in that order.
  Developer mode (binaries alongside the VMM in
  `src/target/release/`) keeps working as before; system
  installs from the new .deb/.rpm packages place the guest
  binaries under `/usr/lib/instar/` per FHS.

### Packaging

- **.deb and .rpm packages** are now produced for x86_64
  Linux as part of the release workflow. The VMM is installed
  at `/usr/bin/instar` and the six guest binaries
  (`core.bin`, `info.bin`, `copy.bin`, `check.bin`,
  `compare.bin`, `convert.bin`) at `/usr/lib/instar/`.
  Local builds: `make deb`, `make rpm`, or `make package`.

### Fixed

- **check:** validate extended L2 subcluster bitmaps against QCOW2
  spec invalid-combination rules. Detects: alloc/zero bit overlap,
  alloc-without-host, host-without-ref, and compressed non-zero
  bitmap. Reports via new `subcluster-errors` JSON field and
  `debug_print` per variant.
- **convert:** write sparse subcluster bitmaps in QCOW2 extended-L2
  output (previously all subclusters were marked as allocated even
  when some contained only zeros).
- **qcow2 read:** narrow I/O for extended-L2 mixed subclusters when
  sector_size ≤ subcluster_size (skips disk reads for zero and
  unallocated subcluster ranges).

### Added (since v0.1)

- **New operations:** check, compare, convert (v0.1 had only
  info and copy)
- **Format crates** extracted into standalone `no_std` libraries:
  qcow2, vmdk, vhd, vhdx, luks, raw
- **Input formats:**
  - Raw (with MBR/GPT partition table validation)
  - QCOW2 v2/v3 (zlib and ZSTD compression, extended L2
    subclusters, AES-CBC and LUKS encryption, external data
    files, snapshots, backing chains)
  - VMDK (monolithicSparse, streamOptimized with DEFLATE
    compression, monolithicFlat and twoGbMaxExtentFlat
    multi-extent input, flat-in-backing-chain via
    parentFileNameHint)
  - VHD (fixed, dynamic, differencing with backing chains)
  - VHDX (dynamic, with CRC-32C validation)
  - LUKS v1/v2 containers (PBKDF2 and Argon2id KDF,
    AES-XTS decryption, inner format detection)
- **Output formats:** raw, QCOW2 v3 (with optional zlib
  compression, configurable cluster size), VMDK
  monolithicSparse (with optional DEFLATE compression,
  configurable grain size) and monolithicFlat (via
  `--subformat monolithicFlat`), VHD dynamic (configurable
  block size), VHDX dynamic (configurable block size)
- **Security model:** all image parsing runs inside a KVM
  sandbox; the host only handles opaque byte streams
- **Backing chain support:** chain discovery, flattening on
  convert, chain validation on check, security allowlist for
  backing file paths
- **qemu-img CLI compatibility:** output format matches
  qemu-img info, check, compare, and convert; auto-detects
  installed qemu-img version for output compatibility
- **Configuration:** layered config files (system, user,
  per-directory) with TOML format
- **Security audits:** static analysis, adversarial image
  testing (61 images, 12 attack categories), CVE reproduction
  (6 CVEs verified mitigated), VMM boundary audit
- **Fuzzing:** 13 coverage-guided fuzz targets, differential
  fuzzing against qemu-img, cross-validation against
  oslo.utils format_inspector
- **Release tooling:** Sigstore-signed tags, pre-compiled
  binary distribution via GitHub Releases

## [0.1] - 2026-01-28

Internal pre-release. Operations: info, copy. Format parsing
was inline (no standalone crates). No check, compare, or
convert operations. No public binary distribution.
